       Çayirköy viaduct is part of the Northern Marmara motorway, an alternative road to link the western part of the country to Istanbul via the 3rd Bosporus Bridge. The 750m long viaduct, made of two carriageways, cross a valley at more than 60m high. This paper gives an overview of the construction methods of this viaduct and focuses on its specificities. The major ones are earthquake loads to be considered during construction and the launching downhill with a - 2.8% slope. The incremental launching method (ILM) has been completely rethought to be adapted to this viaduct. A system has been designed in order to block the deck during stop phases against earthquakes, but also to brake it during launching phases. Temporary structures associate to ILM will also be described in this paper, as one of the challenges was to adapt equipment from previous projects.

       This $558 million design-build-finance project involves the construction of an interchange between SR-826 and SR-836, Miami, United States. 
                    FINLEY designed and provided the construction engineering on four high-level segmental bridge ramps (Bridge Nos. 9, 11, 15 and 19) that traverse the core of the interchange. The segmental bridge ramps were precast, balanced cantilever and were delivered by the Accelarated Bridge Construction method, utilizing an overhead launching gantry for segment erection. The all overhead erection eliminated the need for falsework and cranes as well as eliminated five MOT phases that would have disturbed the traffic and provided a safer work environment. The design reduced maintenance and construction costs with the utilization of external tendons, diabolos and deviators.
                    The bridge lengths varied from 1,100 ft. to 2,450 ft. in length and are 47 ft.-wide with a maximum span length of 266 ft. The curved segmental bridge ramps are the third level of the interchange with radii down to 590 ft. and have a maximum superstructure deck height of 95 ft. above the proposed ground.

       With its impressive scope and high visibility along the Saint Lawrence River, the New Champlain Bridge is the gateway to Montréal.  The 3.4-km lifeline bridge comprises three independent structures: the 529-meter-long, asymmetric cable-stayed bridge that features a single, 169-meter-high tower and stay cables in an aesthetic harp arrangement; the 762-meter-long East Approach; and the 2,044-meter-long West Approach. The superstructure design includes two four-lane corridors for vehicular traffic, a transit corridor for a light-rail transit system, and a multi-use path for pedestrians and bicyclists. 
                    Site challenges include severe winter conditions, wind and seismic hazards, strict navigational requirements, and construction in an urban center. With a design-life of 125 years, the design-build team took a holistic approach in meeting the durability objectives, considering aspects such as environmental exposures, design detailing, materials selection, and construction quality. 
                    The New Champlain Bridge exemplifies innovation in bridge design and construction under rigorous project criteria and site challenges. The new bridge is to be opened to traffic in Spring/ Summer of 2019.  This paper discusses how the project team utilized precasting, modular segments with post-tensioning, and creative erection sequencing to achieve the accelerated schedule of only 42 months from bridge design to substantial completion of construction.

       Jacobs is completing the preliminary and detailed design of two bridge replacements on County Road 17 in Ontario, Canada using an accelerated bridge construction technique known as lateral slide (also known as slide-in-bridge or jack-and-slide) for the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. The Hawkesbury Creek &amp; CNR Overhead is a multi-span slab-on-girder structure spanning a creek and locomotive tracks. The Highway 34 Overpass is a single-span rigid frame structure spanning over the main road leading to the Town of Hawkesbury. The existing structures are approaching the end of their useful service life and rehabilitation is no longer a viable option. The new superstructures will be built on temporary supports located north of the existing structures. The new foundations consist of non-standard integral abutment details supported by composite caissons drilled through the existing roadway using temporary lane closures along County Road 17. This is an alternative to conventional integral abutment design which typically consists of a single row of steel H-piles. County Road 17 will be closed for up to four weeks to permit rapid demolition of the existing structures followed by the lateral slide. This is the first integral abutment lateral slide in the Province of Ontario. New design concepts, non-standard details and construction sequencing have been developed to achieve an economical, practical and robust design solution.

       Signature Saint Laurent (SSLC) is the consortium comprised of SNC Lavalin, Flatiron Constructors Canada, Dragados USA and EBC, that selected the design and construction for the New Samuel de Champlain Bridge (NSCB) in Montreal, Canada.
                    
                    The NSCB’s construction schedule was the major challenge for a successful project completion. The geometry of the main bridge is complex, with an asymmetric stay cable arrangement and a unique transverse behavior with three independent corridors connected by crossbeams, involving the location of the stay cable anchorages. This geometry questioned the constructability and the stringent schedule requirement. The subject of this paper is relevant to this conference as it pertains to an innovative construction method for cable-stayed bridges.
                    
                    The back span was fully erected on temporary towers in advance, followed by the main span which was to be built with heavy lifting equipment in cantilever sequentially from the main single pylon towards to the East approach. A set of three gantries erected the preassembled segments from the ground to the tip of the deck, where they were connected to the previous segment.
                    
                    To expedite the construction, an innovative method was developed to erect some segments from the opposite end with cranes from the ground, with a stick-built conventional method. The closure location was therefore shifted by 50 meters (four segments) towards the pylon. These segments would be supported with temporary stay cables anchored to a 36-meter high king-post on top of the deck. The king-post would be sitting on top of the deck, supported temporarily by shoring towers to reduce the demands in the superstructure and adjacent pier.
                    
                    This erection system can serve as an alternative method to expedite construction for long span single tower cable stayed bridges, by erecting segments with a temporary stay tower from the opposite end, therefore reducing schedule constraints.

       Increasing pedestrian safety by separating it from heavy car traffic is one of the most important issues of communication in modern cities. This can be obtained by creating independent routes for pedestrians and cyclists, e.g:
                    - routes along river banks, also placed on cantilever decks fixed to the embankment walls or bridge abutments;
                    - construction of footbridges in high pedestrian traffic areas, which can be "landmark" structures adding value to the city landscape and activating public space apart from its utilitarian function;
                    - using cable cars over rivers or dense urban areas.
                    The paper will present different possible solutions to this problem, based on the examples of structures built or planned in Polish cities.

       In recent years, an increasing number of private firms are involved in public works using the funding strategy of public-private partnerships (PPPs), especially for civil infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. In this paper, a framework is proposed to quantify the potential benefits of condition assessment in the operation phase. The updated safety condition of highway bridges is introduced as a constraint of the profit optimization problem. The framework includes the following three steps. First, structural identification is carried out to identify parameter values of the bridge involved in the highway project. Then the reserve capacity under the relevant limit state is calculated based on the requirements of bridge design codes. The last step is to investigate the effects of reserve capacity on the optimal operating profit. This framework is applied to a highway flyover project in Singapore. The optimal operating profit based on quantified reserve capacity increases relative to the case without information of reserve capacity. This significant potential economic benefit associated with bridge condition assessment in the operation phase of toll highways.

       In urban areas, besides structures such as bridges and buildings, big sculptures are each day more common as major pieces of public art. Although these artworks are not meant to satisfy needs as housing or transport, they play an important role in the city: they are major pieces of art made accessible to everyone that enhance the environment and contribute to the urban planning.
                    Major sculptures must withstand the same load types as the rest of the city's infrastructure, for example strong winds and earthquakes. The analysis of these structures is an unorthodox field for civil engineers where new challenges appear: complex shapes, innovative materials, new fabrication techniques… Moreover, public art is a field that continually evolves. Art and engineering become two aspects of the same creative process and the interaction between professionals is fundamental.
                    In this work, several success cases in design, fabrication and installation of artworks by some international artists in inhabited areas all over the world are presented. We reflect on the limits in analysis and design focusing on the limitations imposed by the engineering codes. The search for compromise solutions that produce safe structures that still send the artist's message is also discussed.

       This paper aims to present the construction techniques and development of first and unique monorail system in Bangkok, Thailand. Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. The city occupies 1,568.7 km2 and has a population of over eight million, or 12.6 percent of the country's population. In the last decade, Bangkok has attracted millions of migrants seeking economic opportunity and city is expanding quickly. Recently, Mass Rapid Transit Authority (MRTA) Thailand has decided to adopt monorail system in Bangkok as a rapid transit system due to the limited space, narrow roads and sharp curves in the city. The design of monorail track lines permits flexible and various alignments that include curves of small radiuses and large slopes. The first two projects i.e., Pink Line and Yellow Line projects consist of elevated structure around 64.9 km long, 53 stations, 2 depots and 2 park-and-ride buildings. MRTA has awarded these projects (design, test run and construction of first two lines) to the BSR Joint Venture who invited Sino-Thai Engineering &amp; Construction Public Company Limited (STECON), Thailand, as exclusive contractor to be responsible for civil works including design, construction and installation of different components. In contrast to the traditional monorail girders, STECON proposed a novel four-span post-tensioned girder system in which pre-cast monorail girders will be post-tensioned in such a way that post-tension tendons will run through four consecutive spans. The salient features of the proposed system are low cost, safe and less construction time.

       The purpose of this article is to identify and assess the degree of impact and likelihood of occurrence of the risk factors on construction mega bridge with Kuwait construction industry. After a comprehensive review of the pertinent literature, a mixed method research approach is utilized involving in-depth interviews and subsequently a structured questionnaire survey.  The questionnaires survey was conducted with local stakeholders within the Kuwait construction industry who were employed in both private and government sector. The results suggested that the different groups of organizations responded to the technical risks more than other risks. A significant difference is observed in the perception of the critical of these factors based on the stakeholder's level of experience and sector of organization. The correlation test between the risk category groups which indicated that there is a positive relationship between the risk categories' group variables. The results suggest that there are numerous relationship levels existing in the results of the correlation test. The output results from this study can guide construction stakeholders to distinguish the critical risks associated with mega bridge projects so that they can consequently establish a suitable and comprehensive framework for risk mitigation.

       Globalization is shrinking the world in many senses, but at the rates at which it is happening in various countries is different depending on where any country is situated on the scale of development; however, in construction industry, the level of globalization is much lower than in other segments of the economy, across most of the countries. True and the desired level of globalization can be achieved only when the design and construction practices are globally harmonized but adopting context-specific customization to accommodate the genius of each country. This paper aims to promote such diversity in unity. The global construction industry will be the biggest beneficiary of such a globalizing movement. World has faced several crises in different countries due to many reasons like war, terrorism, bad governance, which is leading to unemployment even among highly capable engineers. A globalized environment in construction would leverage global talent despite such adverse socio-political and environmental differences. Cost-optimization is likely to take on a different meaning, gaining a wider level of acceptability across the globe.

       Assessment of the load-carrying capacity of existing concrete structures is often based on the concrete compressive strength obtained from drilled cores. These cores are typically drilled perpendicular to the concrete surface, under the assumption that the mechanical properties of the concrete are isotropic. Recent studies however showed that concrete may in fact be subject to anisotropic behaviour. These studies are limited to newly-cast concrete only, and little is known about the anisotropic behaviour of existing structures in-service. This paper presents the first results of a large experimental programme where the anisotropy of the compressive strength in existing concrete structures is investigated. For this, 195 cores, drilled from a large concrete bridge located in Denmark, are tested. Three drilling directions are considered. The results are analysed using statistical techniques. The results showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the compressive strength in longitudinal and transverse/vertical direction, with an average value of 4.5 MPa in the disadvantage of the longitudinal direction.

      <div>
       Bond degradation due to rebar corrosion and fatigue loading may affect the serviceability and even safety of reinforced concrete (RC) bridges. 15 specimens confined with stirrups were cast for eccentric pull-out tests, and 12 of them were corroded with the target mass loss of 0.03 by the impressed current method. Monotonic pull-out tests were conducted on three corroded and three uncorroded specimens. Wavy descending branch was found in bond stress-slip test curves of uncorroded specimens attributed to stirrup confinement, however it disappeared in those curves of the corroded specimens due to the corrosion loss of rebar transverse ribs. Based on the tested monotonic bond strength, the other nine corroded specimens of different fatigue damages were obtained through repeated loading with different levels and cycles before undergoing monotonic pull-out tests. It is observed that the relative slip increases with a gradually decreasing rate as the loading cycles increase. The monotonic tests of specimens with fatigue damage show that the bond strength increases to a certain value and then decreases with the increase of fatigue loading cycles. Moreover, the higher the loading level is, the fewer cycles are needed to reach the maximum bond strength. In addition, the peak slip corresponding to bond strength decreases with the increase of fatigue loading cycles.

       The framework of pre-posterior decision analysis has a large potential as a decision support tool in structural engineering. It seems ideally suited to tackle problems related to determining the value of Structural Health Monitoring and is commonly applied in inspection and maintenance planning. However, the application of this methodology for integrated life-cycle cost decision making related to monitoring of time-dependent and spatial degradation phenomena in concrete structures, needs further investigation. In this work, the time-dependent and spatial degradation phenomena will be coupled to the pre-posterior decision making approach and applied on concrete beams under bending, subjected to corrosion of the reinforcement. A framework is set up to determine the value of information of inspections enabling adequate decision-making. The methodology incorporates Bayesian updating based on the uncertain inspection outcomes. The framework will be illustrated by application on a simply supported reinforced concrete beam.

       When faced with the problems of aging infrastructure and historic constructions, there are many unknowns such as physical properties and arrangements of materials.  This information is necessary for estimating the capacity, safety, and overall condition and for ensuring successful maintenance or repair of the structure.  Often, this information is only available through invasive means, which can be unsightly, legally prohibited, or too expensive.  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a noninvasive assessment tool successful at infrastructure inspection, feature detection, and condition assessments.  An experiment was designed to investigate the ability of GPR to predict the physical properties (compressive strength, young's modulus, and porosity) of concrete samples.  A set of samples with variable properties and mix designs was fabricated.  The samples were tested both with traditional methods (physical destructive testing) and by noninvasive GPR scanning at 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. A variety of machine learning approaches were used to investigate correlations between the physical property data and the GPR data, resulting in a model that predicts the density, compressive strength, and porosity of concrete with some success (R2-values between 0.4 and 0.8).  This predictive model is currently being further developed and tested on several case studies.

       In urban environments, historic and significant structures are often altered or adapted multiple times for new uses to meet the needs of society. These modifications may occur years apart over the life of the structure, resulting in a combination of different materials and structural systems.  Modern-day designers need to fully understand not only the original archaic construction but also the changes imposed during the prior modifications.  Drawings for the original building, and subsequent modifications, oftentimes are lacking or incomplete and an investigation is needed to identify the configuration of the existing structure and the various material properties.  When considering restoration and strengthening, the information obtained from a well-planned investigation and evaluation can maximize retention of the historic fabric of the structure.
                    In this paper/presentation we discuss the importance of performing an investigation prior to modifying the existing structure, the components of an investigation for historic or significant structures, and the challenges that can arise during the investigation process.

       Condition ratings of bridge components in FHWA's Structure Inventory and Appraisal database are determined by bridge inspectors in the field, often by visual confirmation or direct-contact sounding techniques. However, the determination of bridge condition ratings is generally subjective depending on individual inspectors' knowledge and experience, as well as varying field conditions. There are also limitations to access, unsafe working conditions, and negative impacts of lane closures to account for.  This paper describes an alternative method to obtaining informative and diagnostic inspection data for concrete bridge decks: mobile nondestructive bridge deck evaluation technology. The technology uses high-definition infrared and visual imaging to monitor bridge conditions over long-term (or desired) intervals. This combination of instruments benefits from rapid and large-scale data acquisition capabilities. Through its implementation in Japan over the course of two decades, the technology is opening new possibilities in a field with much untapped potential. Findings and lessons learned from our experience in the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania are described as examples of highway-speed mobile nondestructive evaluation in action. To validate the accuracy of delamination detection by the visual and infrared scanning, findings were proofed by physical sounding of the target deck structures.

       Collecting the information of traffic load, especially heavy trucks, is crucial for bridge statistical analysis, safety evaluation, as well as maintenance strategies. This paper presents a traffic sensing methodology that combines a deep learning based computer vision technique with the influence line theory. Theoretical background and derivations are introduced from both aspects of structural analysis and computer vision techniques. In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed traffic sensing method through field tests, a systematic analysis is performed on a continuous box-girder bridge. The obtained results show that the proposed method can automatically identify the vehicle load and speed with promising efficiency and accuracy, and most importantly cost-effectiveness. All these features make the proposed methodology a desirable bridge weigh-in-motion system, especially for bridges already equipped with structural health monitoring system.

       The development of methods aiming at assuring the maintenance of existing bridges and at minimum cost is a priority. Inspection and diagnosis methods are usually planned based on periodic visual inspections. In the case of concrete bridges, the characterization of cracking plays an extremely important role to monitor their structural health. However, current inspections are rudimentary and work intensive (inspectors take hand notes and pictures that later upload to reports and management software), prone to human error (since cracks are detected by inspectors onsite) and expensive ('underbridge' trucks are required). Therefore, alternative automatic methods will represent a breakthrough regarding the state-of-the-art. 
                     In this paper the method Aerial Crack View (ACV) is presented. ACV is a semi-automatic method to detect cracks in concrete bridges, based on processing images acquired by terrestrial working-station (TWS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The method was applied in Rainha Santa Isabel Bridge, in Coimbra, Portugal, for validation. ACV revels advantages such as, fastness because the detection of cracks is automatically conducted and cost-effective since UAVs can provide information on less accessible elements dismissing expensive access means.

       Remote sensing is widely viewed as a potentially disruptive technology in the realm of bridge engineering, especially as it relates to assessment and forecasting of future performance. Initial applications for LiDAR in bridge engineering were limited to measuring large-scale dimensions such as span length and clearance, underutilizing the vast majority of the data gathered. Improvements in data processing and proper manipulation open the possibility of exploiting LiDAR for estimating smaller dimensions which have direct relevance on structural capacity estimation. Furthermore, the comprehensive nature of LiDAR datasets allows calculating global displacements, warping, and deformations caused by local loads or damages at any desired point of the scanned structure. To investigate the practicality of this potential, a suite of LiDAR scans were carried out during a destructive test on a heavily skewed steel multi-girder bridge. Displacement results drawn from the point cloud were between 9% and 12% less compared to the displacements gathered from conventional sensors. In addition, the progression of girder warping was also registered and quantified by the LiDAR dataset. This study provides a detailed accounting of the current state of LiDAR as a potential bridge assessment tool compared to more conventional sensing and visual inspection approaches.

       The development of the fourth industrial revolution has influenced various industrial fields worldwide. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is expected to be one of the most commercialized areas in the world for the next decade. Since the importance of building safety checks in South Korea is growing, this study focuses on developing a preliminary safety inspection process with UAV, specifically for cracks and deformation. The process includes various methods to improve surveying efficiency, such as thermography, machine learning algorithms, and 3D point cloud modeling. After proposing the inspection process, detailed structural evaluating methods are verified against a conventional method. The image processing method is performed to examine exterior defects, and quantitative defect evaluation methods are applied using 3D point cloud models of buildings. As a result, a crack map, crack depth, and deformations of structures are obtained. Error rates are compared between the proposed method and the conventional method. This paper presents an aerial image-based approach using the UAV for inspecting cracks and deformations of buildings.

     Hidden Strength in Historic Buildings

       Most historic buildings include structural materials and systems that are in some way obsolete. This can range from materials no longer available (first-growth timber) to those no longer considered safe in modern codes for new use (cast-iron columns). There is a large class of buildings that contain systems that are no longer used but are safe in use; because these systems are not used in new buildings, they are not discussed in current code.
                    This paper reviews three obsolete structural systems that have a history of good performance and that have more capacity than ordinary modern analysis would suggest. First, terra-cotta tile arch floors are known to be strong for their expected (gravity) loading, but can also, through pseudo-composite action, strengthen the wrought-iron or steel beams supporting them. Second, draped-mesh (catenary) floors have a load capacity defined by their reinforcing, but have shown to be stiffer than expected because of multiple load paths within the slabs. Finally, the heavy masonry curtain walls typical used with steel-frame buildings before 1920 provide alternate load paths, additional stiffness, and additional capacity for lateral loads. The presence of these systems can mean that historic buildings are stronger than we think.

       For projects focused on restoration and strengthening of historic structures, information about the origins, magnitude, and stability implications of damage to a structure are required. The objective of this work is to create a novel methodology for understanding the causes of cracks in masonry structures and the resulting effects on global stability. Using Distinct Element Modeling (DEM), the crack patterns of a building can be simulated for a combination of loading scenarios. The results of this method are benchmarked against experimental results and applied to three case studies. The limitations of current physics-based approaches are discussed and a solution using manifold learning is outlined. Manifold learning can be applied to ensembles of crack patterns observed on real or simulated structures to infer damage pathways when the mechanism is unknown. This technique uses a perceptual hashing of the crack patterns to produce an affinity matrix, which is then analyzed by spectral methods to learn a small set of parameters which can describe the ensemble. Because the affinity is derived from a sparse perceptual hash, these descriptors can then be used to interrogate the manifold via a "lifting" operation which reveals the dominant failure modes in the sample.

       The historic building "Du Pont" in Zurich, Switzerland, was finished at 1913 and is listed as a cultural heritage object including the reinforced concrete structure. The building includes several particularities, such as slender, one-way ribbed slabs, a hanging reinforced concrete truss in the roof and transfer beams diverting the loads from upper floors. This paper presents a description of the strengthening measures required to allow a more flexible use of the floors and to fulfil the current provisions of the Swiss Standards. The main objective of the proposed measures is to minimize the interventions and preserve the original structural system. Of particular interest is the innovative solution adopted for the ribbed slabs. The required increase of resistance is obtained through a thin 40 mm overlay of UHPFRC above the prepared existing slab. Due to the significance of the building and the particular characteristics of the existing concrete, experimental tests were conducted. Four specimens of the ribbed slabs were extracted from the building, strengthened on-site with UHPFRC and transported to the structural laboratory of the ETHZ, where the tests were conducted. The excellent results confirmed the suitability of the proposed strengthening solution through UHPFRC, setting a milestone for future restorations of these particular structures.

       Masonry structures represent a large part of existing buildings. As confirmed by the damage caused by recent seismic events, the assessment of seismic performance of existing masonry building is then a critical issue in Countries exposed to seismic risk. Moreover, common methods of analysis based on non-linear static approach are significantly influenced by the assumptions about the shear behavior of masonry walls and may lead to inconsistent or contradictory results. 
                    Due to the relevance of the problem ad hoc studies have been performed to clarify how the most relevant parameters affect the theoretical structural behavior and to setup a proper method to define these parameters.
                    In the paper, the main sources of uncertainties regarding the definition of material parameters are investigated and a methodology for the identification of masonry classes is illustrated discussing the propagation of uncertainties related to masonry parameters in non-linear static analysis of masonry buildings. The analysis are carried out through a simplified non-linear pushover type algorithm developed by the authors and the outcomes are illustrated and critically discussed for a relevant case study.
                    The results show the capability of the proposed procedure for the identification of masonry classes and the evaluation of masonry mechanical parameters to provide a more refined probabilistic assessment of the seismic risk index.

       Extraordinary construction projects have been produced throughout time and in all geographic regions and conserving these heritage structures is a demand from society. The preservation and continued use of more mundane existing structures is both sustainable and environmentally responsible, but a just as important an act of culture that helps in safeguarding, recognizing and continuing cultural and historic traditions.
                    In this paper, the authors aim to understand historical construction practices by focusing on historically significant buildings and structures in different countries. The paper presents an overview and analysis of strategies and approaches for handling the preservation process used in case studies presented in SED 15 published by IABSE. 
                    The analysis aims (1) to discover the problems in the design of interventions in heritage structures, (2) to discuss the question for interventions or no interventions on existing structures as a question of risk, (3) to show how interventions on existing structures can be reached successfully under current conditions and restrictions, (4) to present the basis on which IABSE Task Group 2.1 aims to work on guidelines for existing/heritage structures.

       Restoration and Conversion of a Historic Building into a New Learning Park
                    Keywords: Restoration, Independent support
                    In 2013, a local government official of Nakhon Ratchasima Province in Thailand undertook a project to restore a 2-story building in historic zone. The 976-square-meter building was converted into a new learning park for the general public, while preserving most of the original features, including the significant structures. Architects, engineers, etc. were required to collaborate on the project. To fulfil these requirements, it was necessary to follow a precise procedure, the main steps of which were the survey, assessment, safety evaluation, choice of design criteria and techniques, construction, and finally, controls. The study analyzed the design of the building and it was found that significant modification to the structures were necessary. A structural engineer decided to build new steel structures above and below the existing floors to support new timber slabs above them. Sufficient gap was provided between the new and existing structure to provide separation and so maintain their independence. Also, this necessitated the construction of new separate footings to give independent support to all the new loads. The new learning park was opened in 2017.

       A new city quarter with a ground area of 45,000 m²2; utilizing the existing and heritage-protected facades was built along a historical bridge between two major historical streets in Hamburg, Germany. The quarter is comprised of a variety of residences as well as commercial uses. The special complexity of the design challenge stemmed from the narrow inner-city environment and the corresponding constraints, especially due to the complex configuration of the various buildings, the directly adjacent neighbouring structures, the location between various water bodies as well as the complex requirement due to heritage protection laws. Also, some buildings crossed the important water body (referred to as "Alsterfleet").

       The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is located on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. The Kennedy Center is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera and The Suzanne Farrell Ballet. In addition to being the nation's busiest arts facility, the Kennedy Center is also a "Living Memorial" to President Kennedy. The south expansion of the Kennedy Center, known as the REACH, provides much needed educational and rehearsal space, as well as a pedestrian link to the nearby Memorials. 
                    The new structure combines practicality, versatility and innovation. Each surface and space created is unique, forming complex geometries and large span to depth ratios. The cast-in-place concrete structure is exposed on the interior or the exterior, including three white concrete pavilions rising out of the landscaped substructure. The pedestrian bridge connects the Kennedy Center to the river with over a 35-to-1 span to depth ratio. The REACH is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2019.

     Terra Cotta Flat Arches: A Historic Modern-Day Challenge

      <div>
       At the turn of the 20th century, terra cotta flat arches (TCFA's) were a popular floor system in steel framed buildings for industrial and office construction in the United States.  These arches were lighter but just as fireproof as standard brick arches, and were designed empirically using proprietary allowable load tables, which were based mostly on load testing. 
                    In the 21st century, the proprietary nature of the TCFA makes evaluating these systems problematic for the modern engineer, architect, and contractor.  Renovations of buildings with TCFA floor assemblies typically will have new penetrations as well as altered loading conditions from its original construction.  
                    It is important for all parties involved in the design and construction process of a renovation to understand the history, mechanisms, and limitations of TCFAs in order to have a successful renovation from both a design and a cost perspective.  Conversely, renovating a building without the proper knowledge or experience with the existing materials can lead to change orders, time overruns, and most importantly life safety risks.
                    This paper is a summary of a presentation given by the same author to the Association for Preservation Technology (APT) conference in September, 2018.  A more in-depth paper by the same author and colleagues Derek Trelstad and Rebecca Buntrock will appear as an article in the APT Bulletin in 2019.

       This paper reviews the possibilities of the application of Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) for strengthening existing structures in Bulgaria. Although the application of UHPFRC in structural engineering is increasing worldwide in the last decades, both for strengthening and for new designs, we have to admit that in Bulgaria it is still highly restricted. This is mainly due to the lack of experience and knowledge in design engineers, contractors and clients. 
                    In order to investigate the possibilities of its local production in concrete plants and to gain experience in its application for strengthening existing structures, a research project in the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy in Sofia has started recently. Under this project strengthening of steel orthotropic bridge decks as well as reinforced concrete beams is envisaged.  
                    The paper emphasizes particular issues and challenges related to the practical application of UHPFRC in the local conditions of Bulgaria. General recommendations are given for the different options as well.
                    The results and experience gained from the research project will be used in the future to promote the application of UHPFRC in Bulgaria for durable repairs and strengthening of existing steel bridges with orthotropic decks and reinforced concrete structural elements.

       The Krause Gateway Center, located in Des Moines Iowa, is the brain child of Renzo Piano Building Workshop (with OPN Architects) and re-defines what the term "office building" means. As the structural engineers, we were challenged with achieving a vision, that, when constructed, doesn't appear to be possible. The extreme cantilevers, double height spaces, open column bays, free floating stairs and cantilevered exteriors posed challenges rarely seen before. The ability to mitigate each of these with a single material was critical to the success of the project and the need for meeting the architectural requirements for slenderness and clearances. 
                    The innovative solutions to each of the noted challenges will be discussed using the Krause Gateway Center as a model to show what can be accomplished with steel.

       This paper presents dedicated frameworks, developed within European-funded projects, to create integrated seismic risk models from scratch for developing countries and raise the awareness of the general society. Focusing on the case-studies of Nablus in Palestine and Blida in Algeria, the different components of the risk model (hazard, exposure and vulnerability) are described. In specific, details re provided on: improved Hazard models (taking into account historical and instrumental catalogues for the West Bank and Northern Algeria); the collection of exposure and fragility data on buildings and bridges throughout the case-study regions, used to develop specific exposure and vulnerability models; the definition of social vulnerability models through census-based and scorecard approaches. Subsequently, the integration of the different components is carried out towards the calculation of integrated risk and considerations on the specificities surrounding developing countries are made. The final products of the seismic risk models can be used by different stakeholders to quantify risk and plan mitigation measures.

       A device aiming at preventing bridge flutter is studied. It consists of fixed wings positioned with a large lateral offset along the edges of the bridge deck. The wings are attached to the bridge deck by means of lateral support structures. Flutter analyses for various kinds of bridges and wind-tunnel tests confirm the flutter-suppression effectiveness of the wings. They constitute a passive damping device without moving parts. This is an advantage over devices with moving parts, which meet resistance due to reliability and maintenance concerns. The main findings to date concerning analysis, flutter-suppression effectiveness, and cost-efficiency of the eccentric-wing flutter stabilizer are summarized. In addition, a simplified approach for the analysis of torsional flutter of a bridge equipped with this device is presented and applied to the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It is found that with relatively small effort the flutter stability of that bridge could have been substantially improved.

       Modern numerical computational tools are available to evaluate bridge aerodynamics. An effective parametrization can be applied to analyze different alternatives. Steady and self-excited aerodynamics investigations were performed with the help of modern CFD tools, in order to improve the overall bridge design. Different airflow control alternatives for bridge deck aerodynamics are investigated, such as installation of wind shields, installation of guide vanes, protective traffic and wind fences. These elements influence the aerodynamic performance and can lead to a reduction of global bridge response. The early design phase is most suited for the introduction of these possibilities and optimization processes. Successful design can be achieved by utilizing different aerodynamic aspects of torsional divergence check, galloping, multimodal flutter instability and their effects on the global bridge response. Presented works are some alternatives from expert group work on the multi-pontoon floating bridge project Bjørnafjorden. Complex global bridge response consists of structural bridge dynamics, hydrodynamic interaction and wind interaction. Aerodynamic optimization can lead to better use of material in the structure. The publications is a collection of work performed on different aerodynamics tasks, offering comprehensive overview of wind design.

       This paper describes theoretical bases on forming equivalent static wind loads for large bridges. A method is proposed for efficient handling of large number of load cases when vibration and structural analysis is extended to skew winds, i.e., to cases when wind direction is not transverse or longitudinal respect to the bridge. Skew winds appears to be increasingly important in many practical cases. Frequency-domain approach with spectral-density analysis is used as theoretical bases, as this allows exact application of crucial frequency-dependent parameters like statistical wind turbulence parameters; aerodynamic damping; aerodynamic admittances and modal coupling. 
                    It is concluded that mutual complexity of using large number equivalent static wind load cases could be kept on the reasonable level when using automation of the present commercial structural analysis software. Alternate approach used occasionally in practice is to apply time-domain methods directly with the software. It is discussed that in the case of vertical wind load on deck this may lead to two to three times overestimates, as the frequency-dependency of parameters is omitted. It is proposed that wind-tunnel testing laboratories, or other wind engineers specialist with bridge analysis expertise, should more often include equivalent static wind load extraction to their service.

       Kruunuvuori Bridge is new link to connect Laajasalo area
                    to the Helsinki city center by crossing a Kruunuvuorenselkä bay. It's a cable
                    stayed bridge with a single pylon and symmetric span arrangement, designed to
                    be built with free cantilever method. For such a structure, wind is a governing
                    load both for the construction and for the final stage. 
                    In the Engineering design of the bridge, equivalent
                    static wind load extraction was used to define the action forces for the structures
                    due to the wind. With the applied method it is possible to include crucial
                    frequency-dependent parameters like statistical wind turbulence parameters;
                    aerodynamic damping; aerodynamic admittances and modal coupling into the design.
                    Skew wind angles could  also be defined. Such
                    loads are easy to apply with general commercial software and the workflow for
                    the design is practical. As the method itself is not standardized and includes
                    specialist defined parameters, it requires an additional verification. This
                    paper describes how the static equivalent wind loads were applied in the design
                    and how the results were verified with full-aeroelastic model wind tunnel testing.
                    As a conclusion, static wind load extraction provides reliable results and is a
                    practical approach for bridge design under skew winds.

       Tropical cyclones are multi-hazard events capable of simultaneously affecting structures with wind, storm surge and rainfall. In practice, these concurrent hazards are typically treated independently using separate return level curves. Understanding this joint exposure, however, is critical for accurately assessing the structural vulnerability of buildings. We present such an analysis in study by investigating the joint and conditional return periods of two major cyclone hazards—wind and storm surge. To do so, a database of 566 synthetic cyclone events passing within 250 km of The Battery in New York City is first generated. Next, the Holland gradient wind profile and the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model are used to simulate the maximum wind speed and peak storm tide for each synthetic event respectively. Finally, a bivariate copula is used to statistically estimate the joint and conditional return periods of the two hazards.

       MTA New York City
                    Transit suffered significant damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and hired
                    Arup to design a flood mitigation strategy for the various system
                    vulnerabilities. 
                    Arup developed a
                    database and data collection applications to document the various
                    vulnerabilities including at-grade ventilation grating, subway entrances and
                    critical facilities above and below grade.
                    Following
                    identification and documentation, Arup developed near-term mitigation
                    strategies, which could be implemented as soon as possible ahead of the next
                    storm season. Concurrently they developed innovative permanent solutions to
                    mitigate the vulnerabilities for each location, including working with
                    specialty fabricators to develop products for these specific purposes in order
                    to provide the required protection of up to 14 feet of flood depth.
                    These efforts
                    have resulted in innovate, new, purpose driven methods of flood mitigation that
                    were not previously available on the market. These new systems result in
                    dramatically reduced deployment time ahead of a storm event as well as a
                    significant increase in the performance of the mitigation including reduced
                    leakage rates.
                    This paper
                    presents results of this work including discussion of effective data collection
                    and management as well as case studies for the various mitigation strategies

       Hydraulic-related hazards (e.g., flood and scour) are recognized as the leading stressors that threat the safety of bridges during their service life. In addition, climate change has been recently recognized as a significant factor that can drive changes to the frequency and intensity of hydraulic-related hazards. Consequently, current design, management, and decision-making methodologies should adapt to these changes to ensure the satisfactory performance of bridges under these hazards. This paper presents a multi-hazard probabilistic framework that can help bridge officials and decision makers to establish flood fragility curves with respect to service life and variability of the future floods. In this paper, downscaled climate data, adopted from the global climate models, are employed to predict future flood hazards at a given location. Time-variant scour depth profiles based on the predicted streamflow data are then estimated and used to predict the future condition of the bridge. Deep learning networks and finite element modeling are then employed to quantify the structural performance of the investigated bridge under applicable hazards. The proposed framework is illustrated on an existing bridge in Oklahoma.

       As the expectations of populations all around the world continue to increase in relation to the resilience of their bridges and buildings to hazards such as seismic events, the need for appropriate solutions –sh; which can be applied both to new structures and to existing ones –sh; grows accordingly. A wide range of solutions is available, such as shock absorbers and shock transmission units which can be used to dampen or optimally transmit forces that would otherwise damage a structure, and seismic isolators which can protect buildings and bridges from destructive ground motions. Expansion joints can be equipped with features that protect a bridge, at its key movement nodes, from damage due to larger-than-expected movements, and structural health monitoring (SHM) can be used to enable hazards to be identified and to provide immediate notification of any event that might make a structure unsafe. Various such methods of enhancing resilience of structures to seismic and other hazards are described.

       Many of our cities are running out of usable construction space for large buildings. New buildings are reaching new heights and new depths, often extending several stories below-grade. This presents challenges for waterproofing, particularly when building foundations extend below the groundwater table. With climate change and sea-level rise, many geographic areas will increasingly need to consider groundwater.  
                    Building code requirements, especially in seismic regions, often require engineers to design movement joints or separation joints in below-grade structures. But foundation waterproofing materials are designed to seal around a building, not a void or an excavation. Structural joints are more susceptible to leakage, and higher volumes of leakage, than areas with solid backup.  
                    We review design considerations for movement joints and present two case studies: a parking structure with structural separation joints between exterior shotcrete shear walls; and a hospital campus relying on below-grade expansion joints between buildings with differing foundation systems. In both, the presence of below-grade joints necessitates more complicated detailing and installation. 
                    Experience shows us the best practice is to waterproof the building, not the void. Performance is best when the below-grade structural walls provide a solid, continuous substrate. Where movement joints cannot be avoided, we recommend designing structural elements to also meet the needs of the waterproofing system.

       The process to arrive at design wind loads for long-span bridges involves experimental testing and analytical methods. Time domain simulations are becoming increasingly common and many available studies demonstrate results of buffeting response analysis in the time domain. However, there is significantly more to the process than the response analysis to derive wind loads that can be applied practically for design. The current study focuses on two key aspects required to derive design wind loads: prediction of the peak modal deflection and derivation of modal combination coefficients using objective functions.

       The IABSE Task Group 3.1 has the mandate to define reference results for the validation of the software that simulate the aeroelastic stability and the response to the turbulent wind of super-long span bridges. 
                    To this end, the working group is developing a 3-step benchmark. Step 1 is a numerical comparison of different numerical models, with the same inputs: the aeroelastic stability and the buffeting response of both a sectional model (Step 1.2) and a full bridge (Step 1.2) is studied. Step 2 will be the comparison of predicted results and experimental tests in wind tunnel. Step 3 will be a comparison against full scale measurements.
                    The results of Step 1.1 related to the response of a sectional model were presented to the last IABSE Symposium in Nantes 2018. In this paper, the results of Step 1.2 related to the response long-span full bridge will be presented both in terms of aeroelastic stability and buffeting response:  the critical issues and the main differences arisen during the comparison of the results coming from several TG members will be highlighted and discussed. A reference result for the validation of other programs will be given.

       Floating towers are an innovative design solution for long-span bridges crossing deep waters, where grounded towers are not applicable. This kind of structural solution brings about challenging issues related to the design of such structures exposed to the combined action of aerodynamic forces and hydrodynamic forces. One of the major issues is the experimental validation of numerical models to simulate the structural dynamics, based on hybrid codes joining aero-elastic and hydro-elastic interactions. 
                    This paper presents a feasibility study of wind-tunnel aeroelastic tests, where the submerged part of the bridge is simulated by Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) technology: actuators simulates the motion of the floater due to the combined action of the hydrodynamic loads on the floater (numerically simulated in real time) and of the aerodynamic and inertial loads transmitted by the tower (measured by a 6-components dynamometer). A similar HIL testing device has been developed at POLIMI in the field of floating offshore wind turbines, and it is likely to be applied to long-span bridges, as a tool for the experimental validation of complex numerical hybrid approaches.  
                    The opportunities offered by this technology will be discussed in the paper, working out a numerical example where the full-scale response of a FEM of the full-bridge is simulated and then it is scaled in order to assess the feasibility of aeroelastic tests in wind tunnel, with a focus on the characteristics of the actuation system for the tower base: necessary of degrees of freedom, amplitude and bandwidth of motion and force.

       This paper proposes a general procedure for evaluating a nominal value of wind velocity for a wind load-governed limit state to secure a target reliability index during the design life of a structure.  The nominal value of wind velocity, referred to as a basic wind velocity, and wind load factor should be determined so that the factored wind load effect secures a target reliability index for a wind load-governed limit state.  In this study, the analytical form of the return period of the basic wind velocity is expressed as a function of the target reliability index, wind load factor, and statistical parameters of wind pressure, which are derived as linear functions of the coefficient of wind velocity. The proposed approach is applied to the Korean Highway Bridge Design Code-Cable supported Bridge, which specifies the design life of a structure as 100- and 200-year.

      <div>
       The Third Bosporus Bridge is a hybrid suspended bridge with a main span length of 1 408 m and a total length of 2 408 m located at the north of Istanbul near the Black Sea. The main span is partially suspended at the pylons by stiffening cables and at the main cables with vertical hangers. The top of the pylons is located at 320 m; they are composed of 2 concrete shafts. The deck is 5,50 m high and 58 m wide with 4 road lanes in each direction, 2 railways tracks. The steel segments of the central part were lifted with by using strain jacks located on the main suspension cables. The distance between the lifting cables is not so large: 16.0 m in the longitudinal direction and 13.5 m, transversally due to the distance of the main cables. In consequence, the risk of two instability modes induced by the wind during the operations could exist: around the longitudinal axis and around the vertical axis. Very simple home-made tests to visualize the risk and very simple countermeasures will be presented.

       In the design of super-long-span bridges, the wind actions are commonly a governing criterion. Critical design checks for wind-induced vibrations involve experimental and numerical procedures for determination of the flutter instability threshold, commonly under laminar free-stream. The influence of free-stream turbulence on the critical flutter velocity of bridge decks still represents an open topic in bridge aerodynamics. This paper presents an investigation of the influence of free-stream deterministic gusts on the critical flutter velocity using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Deterministic free-stream harmonic gusts are simulated by modelling the wake of two flapping airfoils using the two-dimensional Vortex Particle Method (VPM).  These gusts are then applied to a streamlined bridge deck and the oscillation amplitudes are studied for various gust amplitudes and frequencies. The results indicate that the critical flutter velocity is reduced for harmonic gusts with a frequency similar to the critical frequency under laminar free-stream, while it is not in affect for gust frequencies corresponding to the structural frequencies. By dissecting the random free-stream into harmonic gusts, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the physical processes occurring in the fluid-structure interaction near the instability threshold.

       To be able to perform nonlinear flutter analyses for bridges, time-domain approaches should be used instead of Scanlan's formulation of self-excited forces. Thus, this paper addresses the development and validation of a modified quasi-steady time-domain model similar to Scanlan's approach that is based on the velocity and acceleration of the bridge deck. In this formulation, quasi-steady time-domain flutter derivatives measured in the wind tunnel through forced-vibration tests at absolute constant velocity and acceleration are used. For this, a unique test rig, which can be used either for free- or forced-vibration tests, was utilized. By measuring the time-domain flutter derivatives of the Great Belt Bridge, their nondimensionalization with respect to the bridge-deck width, velocity and acceleration of the deck is validated. Then, time-domain flutter analyses are performed using this new model. They agree with the experimental critical speed and the prediction using Scanlan's model.

       Located in the abandoned site of a previous tower, in the heart of London's financial district, the constraints in the construction of this tower were extreme. 62 storeys, 278m high, currently under construction, it will soon become the second tallest building in Western Europe.
                    Through mega transfer girders, inclined columns with high strength steel cable ties, triple-storey A-frames, partial demolition of the existing basement, and partial top-down construction methodology, the challenges faced at 22 Bishopsgate push the limits of structural engineering whilst providing a sustainable and environmentally conscious building that re-uses 100% of the foundations from a previous building. 
                    22 Bishopsgate will not only become a landmark on the London skyline, but it also possesses some of the most efficient structural engineering we are seeing in tall building design, and hidden below ground in the basement one of the most challenging foundation re-use strategies today.

       In the process of evolution of cities through time, recovering for public use former industrial or railway related areas about to be absorbed (or already absorbed) by the expanding urban fabric is a natural step in the growth of populated areas and a recurrent design problem for engineers and architects.
                    The development of these areas almost always requires the design and construction of new infrastructures that improve accessibility, frequently including new bridges. These bridges will generally have the responsibility of being the first piece of design of ambitious and highly expected transformation projects. For this reason, they need be appropriate in to two very different scenarios: the long temporary situation (sometimes decades) when they are the only object in the area that meets the design standards of the future development and the final scenario when bridge and new city should perform as a whole. Successfully responding to the two different contexts and the variable constraints is an exciting challenge for the bridge designers.
                    This article will explore the keys to be considered when designing bridges that allow and catalyze city growth, using three examples of the authors previous experience.

       London combines a rapidly expanding population with ever-decreasing land availability. This equation continues to attract property investors and allows developers to deliver high quality buildings.
                    Typically, developments must respect local site constraints. London's rich construction archaeology –sh; from Roman times to the post-war period –sh; and the need to future-proof new infrastructure, create a unique blend of challenging constraints.
                    Unlocking such highly constrained sites by devising finely-engineered, sustainable and cost-efficient solutions has generated some of London's most iconic buildings. A typical example is the recently completed Principal Tower, a 50-storey residential development on the edge of the City. Sited between existing 19th century railway tunnels and a protected viewing corridor that restricts building heights, the tower also sits above provision for a future rail tunnel. 
                    WSP overcame these extreme constraints by forming a deep 'concrete box' through the building's basement to support both the tower and the future railway tunnel. Adopting solutions associated more with heavy civil engineering adds significant costs, but enables high value developments on otherwise unremarkable sites. 
                    This paper will examine some of London's most technically challenging sites, such as Principal Tower, TwentyTwo and Newfoundland, and the advanced engineering solutions that have made these iconic buildings possible.

       New York City constitutes one of the most extreme cases of urban concentration due to land scarcity.The development of skyscrapers has been one of the solutions to address the problem and, more often than not, new structures are being built directly over the extensive network of underground infrastructure in the city. The presentation showcases the experience and lessons learned from a selection of projects in the US and UK located directly on top of existing infrastructure. Examples include NYC transit projects spanning from the 1990s, when nine 
                    buildings along Riverside Boulevard and on top of the former Penn Central rail yards were developed, to the ongoing.
                    
                    Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park project where up to six buildings will be erected on top a 320,000sqft platform over train tracks. Amongst other projects, the presentation will include the Hudson Yards development on the east side of Midtown Manhattan located over the subway entrance to the 34th Street station and the Waterline project built over the AmTrak and LIRR train tracks. In the UK case studies include two recent London projects at Royal Mint Gardens and Principal Place. The general focus is aimed at the structural strategies employed and their impact not only in 
                    construction costs but also the long-term effect in the urban fabric.

       The Golden Gate Bridge is currently undergoing an important seismic and wind retrofit program that will include, among other modifications, the addition of jumping deterrent nets and the replacement of structural members. To proceed with these retrofitting activities, platforms and tarps will be temporarily installed on the deck and are expected to have an influence on the sensitivity of the structure to wind-induced vibrations. Because of the transient nature of the structure during this work, a strategy combining experimental methods (sectional model testing) and numerical predictions (time-domain buffeting analysis) was employed to evaluate the bridge aerodynamic performance and to provide guidelines for the construction schemes. In particular, the percentage of the length of the main span and side spans that could be tarped without negatively influencing the aerodynamic stability of the deck was determined. The potential for vibrations such as vortex-induced oscillations, galloping and flutter instabilities was carefully investigated considering a large number of deck tarping scenarios and was compared against desired aerodynamic performance criteria. This paper will outline the methodology applied for the aerodynamic performance evaluation and will describe the main findings and benefits of such an extensive evaluation.

       The Burlington Bay Skyway was built in 1954 and rehabilitated in the 1980s. A continuous three span truss rises from below the deck up over the roadway across the 151 m central span over a navigational channel into Hamilton Harbour. The deck system hangs from the truss and the consequences of a hanger impact could be severe and include prolonged closure, impediment of the navigation channel, and could trigger a progressive collapse of the suspended deck system arising from simply supported stringers and floor trusses. The regional economic impact of bridge closure on one of Ontario's major arteries is considerable.
                    The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) is adding redundancy trusses to transfer the load from the deck system to adjacent hangers in the event of hanger loss. Each truss runs longitudinally below the edge of the deck through the main span, within the depth of the existing transverse floor trusses. The proactive retrofit improves redundancy of the deck system and keeps the bridge serviceable and safe after hanger loss, in-line with current code requirements.

       Fatigue damage is a major topic in bridge maintenance. The fatigue damage to steel bridge deck has been dramatically increasing since the first fatigue damage was observed in Hanshin expressway in early 2000s. Insufficient knowledge of bridge fatigue design and unexpected increase of traffic demand and heavy vehicle could be the cause of the fatigue damage.
                    Replacement of base pavement course to steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) has been generally used for strengthening of steel decks; however, the countermeasure from the topside of the bridge deck could make serious traffic disruption. Therefore, reactive and proactive maintenance for such steel decks has not been well progressed so far.
                    According to the background above, Hanshin expressway has been making an effort on developing new method by strengthening steel deck from the bottom side. The idea of the new method is to enhance fatigue resistance by improving the weld joint between deck plate and U-shaped rib plate. Three potential methods were identified and the effectiveness of those methods was studied in field for making sure of not only fatigue resistance improvement but also field construction.
                    This paper will introduce the new retrofit methods for steel deck and describe the effectiveness of those methods.

       Brooklyn Bridge is a National Historic Landmark that has been in use for over 125 years. This is one of most pictured in the world while being used as critical and vital part of the infrastructure, carrying over 165,000 vehicles per day.  This paper addresses the engineering challenges/solutions related to the most current rehabilitation work being performed.
                    Contract 6 represents an $800 million investment into the bridge to maintain it in a State of Good Repair. Work included deck replacement using accelerated bridge construction techniques and complete painting and steel repairs of the main span. A high-level traffic study and simulations were developed to evaluate differing closure scenarios and their impacts on user costs and the traveling public.
                    Contract 7 represents a $300 million investment that will address the rehabilitation of the historic arches on both sides of the main span and strengthening of the Towers. Construction is expected to begin in 2019.
                    Contract 8 represents a $250 million investment and is in the planning phase.  It will address a new promenade enhancement over the Brooklyn Bridge. For determination of the cable capacity, a tailored bridge-specific cable assessment program for the main cables is being developed.

     Lanciau Bridge – First spatial tubular truss railway bridge

       The old Lanciau bridge, constructed in 1904, needed to be replaced by a new bridge which could allow for a continuous ballasted track.
                    The new bridge has been designed to maintain the spirit of the old one by keeping a truss structure, while modernizing it both from the point of view of its shape (spatial triangular truss with variable height) and its sections (pipes). It has been taken advantage of the presence of the concrete trough to connect it to the steel truss, in order to increase the rigidity of the bridge with the composite effect.
                    The new truss structure is really the key point because of the tubular nodes which do not meet any standards. Indeed, the fatigue resistance analysis of the 3D tubular nodes required the application of specific documentations and results from PhD's, as well as the use of volume finite elements computations.
                    The new Lanciau bridge is now ready to service the MOB panoramic trains and continue the tradition of the Swiss alpine steel railway bridges.
                    This bridge is one of the very first railway bridges made of tubular truss, which won the jury price at the Young Engineer Symposium in Luzern, Switzerland on October.

      <div>
       The Shaded Domepatented is a semi-permanent facility, comprised of an air-supported dome covered by a tensile membrane shade. The two layers are separated by a grid of spacers, through which forces are transferred. In the space between the two layers a constant natural air flow is present, which enables a pleasant internal microclimate. This passive design element provides protection from extreme climatological conditions like solar radiation, wind, high air temperature, humidity and precipitation. The concept provides a design challenge concerning the force balance between the air-supported dome, as the primary stability structure, and the tensile membrane shade which must remain in shape. The Shaded dome provides a solution for example for temporary events, such as World Cups or the Olympics, to replace the large and expensive venues, which often are abandoned once the event is over.
                    Shaded Dome Technologies explored the basic principles of an air-supported dome covered by a shade through rigorous experimenting. Parallel to empirical testing in scaled handmade models, a design model was scripted and its behaviour simulated. These two "methods" were not sequential but informed each other. The concept is cast in a computational design model. This computational model is used to simulate the inflation of the air-supported dome, generate the tensile membrane shade on top, study and vary each aspect of the design and optimise and prepare the geometry for manufacturing. The results produced within this computational framework were further explored and validated using finite element method software. This all lead to the construction of a successful prototype.

       The Pier 55 project in New York City represents an achievement in design, documentation, fabrication and construction achievable only through recent advances in construction technology. Pier 55 is a new park built over the Hudson River constructed from complex precast concrete. It is a one of its kind pier with a signature design by the Heatherwick Studio that undulates in elevation and is structurally composed of tulip shaped concrete "pots". Heatherwick's vision required significant collaborative efforts by all involved to define a geometry that satisfied the often-competing needs for prefabrication efficiency, durability, accessibility, design aesthetics and construction feasibility. Arup and Heatherwick developed parametric tools to automate much of the design process so that multiple iterations of geometry could be tested and refined to find optimal solutions.  Initial scripts to define surface geometry of the "pot" structures for coordination evolved into additional scripts which created analysis models, full structural geometry, and shop drawing level documentation.  As the project moved into construction, Arup and the fabrication team at Fort Miller precast concrete manufacturer and Fab3 steel fabricator utilized the models and scripts generated during the design process for direct digital input of the structural geometry to create complex CNC-milled foam formwork, 3-dimensional rebar documentation, and documentation and digital fabrication of steel components required for assembly and erection of the various pieces by Weeks Marine. This paper will discuss significant innovations including using sophisticated parametric modeling to digitally design, document, fabricate and construct geometrically complex structures.

      <div>
       The effect of the water to fly ash (W/FA), alkali activators to fly ash (Alk/FA), and curing regimes on the workability and compressive strength of the alkali-activated mortar (AAM) was studied. Three high calcium fly ashes (FAs) having different chemical compositions were used. Sodium hydroxide (SH) and sodium silicate (SS) were used as the alkali activators. The two alkali activators were mixed together at ratio of 1.0. Two curing regimes, elevated heat curing in an electric oven at 70 oC for 24 hr and ambient curing at 23 ±smn; 2 oC, were applied. The water to fly ash (W/FA) ratios were 0.350, 0.375, and 0.400. However, the alkali activators to fly ash (Alk/FA) ratios were 0.250, 0.275 and 0.300. The results revealed that the workability and the compressive strength of the oven cured specimens were decreased with increasing the calcium content of FA in the mixture. However, the compressive strength of the specimens that cured under the ambient temperature increased with increasing the calcium content. The workability increased with increasing the W/FA and decreasing the Alk/FA. The compressive strength based on both curing regimes decreased with increasing the W/FA. The optimum Alk/FA was 0.275 with W/FA of 0.400.

       Shear walls in which sheets with burring holes aligned along the vertical direction are fastened to frame members, are applied to low- to mid-rise housings in seismically-active-regions and typhoon- or hurricane-prone-regions. A sheet which is 2.73-m-long, 0.455-m-wide, 1.2mm-thickness with cold-formed burring holes is used for standard 2.73-m-high wall. 4.5-m-high walls were also developed for stores, offices, warehouses.
                    A configuration with burrs on the inside and smooth on the outside enables the construction of omitting the machining of holes for equipment and thinner walls of simplified attachments of finishing.
                    In-plane shear experiments and finite element analyses revealed that the walls that receive the in-plane shear force allow shear stress to concentrate in intervals between the burring holes. The walls changed from the elastic to plastic region and maintained stable strength. The deformation areas in a wall were limited in the intervals between the holes and a large out-of-plane waveform in a sheet was effectively prevented owing to the ring-shaped-ribs of the holes.
                     In this paper, design methods are proposed for evaluating the stiffness of the walls using the idea of decreasing the band-width of the tension fields. The allowable and ultimate design strength formulas were developed.

       The era of research on fly ash based Zero-Cement (ZC) containing alkali activated geopolymer mortar and concrete has already begun. By replacing 100% of cement which is the higher carbon footprint material and also by maintaining a steady level on eco-system without causing severe environmental damage or exhausting natural resources, geopolymer technology is on the way to be the most popular sustainable construction material. However, the mixing mechanism of geopolymer is very difficult using the liquid alkaline activators which are hazardous as well as difficult to handle in large construction works at sites. As a result, the development of producing one-part geopolymer or "just add water" process similar to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) construction, is necessary for the promotion of this green and sustainable construction material to the society. To this end, two different sources of Class C fly ash (FA) from Missouri State, USA are used in this study to investigate the mechanical as well as the fresh properties of ZC mortar and concrete. In this study, the dry sodium hydroxide (SH) pellets and sodium silicate (SS) powder are used as solid alkaline activators. Three different curing systems, e.g. ambient, oven and steam curing are employed in this study and corresponding strength gains are evaluated. A significant enhancement of the compressive strength was achieved by the addition of 1.9 mass% of sucrose (sugar) with respect to FA in the mix after curing at the elevated temperature.
